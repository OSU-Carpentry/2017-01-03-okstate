Learning how to use “Git” was a wonderful experience. Its so simple!!,How to deploy python code on something other than the Jupyter interface.
So useful material.,I needed a little more explanation on what some of the functions were doing – didn’t really understand the coordinates chosen on assert range - overlap()
Great Job.,"It would be helpful to explain motivation and purpose, then define terms. In this function definition, “key words” should be distinguished from regular arguments. Def f(x) vs. def f(x=1)."
Good job!,Maybe give more background info for how we may use these things.
Great job!,"range.overlap([(0.0, 2.0), (2.0, 3.0)]) what is the use of [ and inner ( brackets?"
Went at a good pace.,It would help me if I knew what some functions were for like the zeros function from numpy makes an array of zeros with a shape input.
Went slowly and carefully through bash point.,"Presentation a little confusing, would be good to have explanation sheet about assertions etc. to refer to."
Good job overall would have wanted to see the command line controls finish.,No comment.
Intentionally learning about errors (making the on purpose) is very helpful.,I feel like that the preparation work before actually writing codes in Python is more difficult. Can you guys talk about that please?
"Great module! Very useful, relevant information.",The pace was way too slow. Would have liked to see what we didn’t get to even without following along on my own computer.
I liked the for loop discussion.,Some functions were not clear and needed more explanation.
Have a taste of Python programming. Thank you! :),"Overall, I would love to join a workshop on “classes and objects” with Python."
Explaining what each line in the code will do was helpful.,"Creating multiple branches, merging branches, and working form multiple repositories would be fantastic!"
"You moved this along at a good pace. Not too fast, not too slow.",
I liked “Assertion” topic session and ‘Defensive Programming.’,
"Real-time programming, with mistakes and corrections is cool.",
Learned a lot about Python especially assertions.,
Informative. Thank you. :),
I like learning the assert command.,
